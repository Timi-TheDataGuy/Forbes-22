# FORBES ‘22
Data Source is Excel. Used Power BI for the cleaning, transformation & analysis to draw out insights from the Forbes '22 Billionaire's list dataset. 

Since its inception in 1987, the Forbes Billionaire’s list has been one that has consistently attracted millions of engagements across the globe. The Forbes Billionaire’s List is an annual documentation of the World’s Billionaires. The list is based on their individual Net Worth which is based on their total documented assets, debts and other factors. 

A new development came up in 2018 as Forbes introduced Philanthropy Score as an additional index to consider in the listings. This write up shows how the 2022 Forbes List data was analyzed using Power BI.
