# FORBES - 2022 World's Billionaire's List Analysis using SQL
Data Source is Excel. Used Power BI for the cleaning, transformation & analysis to draw out insights from the Forbes '22 Billionaire's list dataset. 

Since its inception in 1987, the Forbes Billionaire’s list has been one that has consistently attracted millions of engagements across the globe. The Forbes Billionaire’s List is an annual documentation of the World’s Billionaires. The list is based on their individual Net Worth which is based on their total documented assets, debts and other factors. 

A new development came up in 2018 as Forbes introduced Philanthropy Score as an additional index to consider in the listings. The Philanthropy score is an enhanced score that measures the generosity of the Billionaires. The Philanthropy Score ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.

# Data Exploration and Storytelling
I went into this analysis with three questions set at heart to answer — 
1. Based on the data, who is the most Philanthropic Billionaire?
2. Based on the data, which Industry that drives the highest number of Billionaires?
3. Based on the data provided, which Industry that drives the highest amount in terms of net worth?
